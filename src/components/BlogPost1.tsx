              </p>
              
              <h2>ü§ñ Meet Your Personal AI Gift Concierge</h2>
              <p>
                Imagine having a personal assistant who never forgets a birthday, always knows the perfect gift, and handles everything from selection to delivery. That's exactly what SimplySent delivers! Our AI concierge service is designed to handle all your gift-giving needs with the intelligence of artificial intelligence and the warmth of human thoughtfulness.
              </p>
              
              <h2>üì± How SimplySent Works (It's Ridiculously Simple!)</h2>
              <p>
                We've made gift-giving as easy as sending a text message. Here's how our magic works:
              </p>
              
              <div className="my-8 flex justify-center">
                <img src="/app_screenshot2.png" alt="SimplySent App Features" className="max-w-md w-full rounded-2xl shadow-lg border border-gray-200" />
              </div>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong> Add your friends and family to the app - just their name, age, and a few interests (like "loves coffee and hiking" or "obsessed with skincare").
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong> Set your budget and mark important dates like birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> Let our AI work its magic! It analyzes their interests, age, and current trends to recommend the perfect gift.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> Approve the selection (or let the AI choose automatically), and we handle payment and delivery. Done! üéâ
              </p>
              
              <h2>üîÑ The "Set It and Forget It" Subscription</h2>
              <p>
                Here's where SimplySent gets really exciting - our optional subscription model! Set it up once in just 2 minutes, and you'll never have to worry about that person's gifts again. Our AI learns and evolves, picking new and exciting gifts each year within your specified budget.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine never forgetting your mom's birthday, your partner's anniversary, or your best friend's graduation. The app remembers everything and ensures every gift feels personal and thoughtful, not automated.
              </p>
